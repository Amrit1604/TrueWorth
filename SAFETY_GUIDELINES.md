### 📋 Best Practices

✅ **Check robots.txt before scraping**
✅ **Start with small, infrequent requests**
✅ **Monitor for rate limiting responses**
✅ **Use APIs when available instead**
✅ **Cache results to reduce requests**
✅ **Be transparent about your scraping**

### 🔧 If You Get Blocked

1. **Stop scraping immediately**
2. **Wait 24-48 hours before trying again**
3. **Reduce request frequency**
4. **Check if you violated any terms**
5. **Consider using official APIs instead**

### 📞 Contact & Responsible Use

If a website asks you to stop scraping or blocks your IP:

- **Contact them if you need data for legitimate research**
- **Consider official APIs or data partnerships**
- **Never attempt to circumvent blocks**
